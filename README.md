Usage
To use the application, follow these guidelines:

Set up a database management system (e.g., MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL) and create a database for the amusement parks.
Update the connection string in the project configuration file (appsettings.json or web.config) to point to your database.
Run the application and interact with it via the provided user interface or API endpoints.
This project utilizes the Dapper framework for data access, which simplifies database operations and improves performance. The Dapper framework provides a lightweight object-mapping capability to retrieve and store data in the database.
